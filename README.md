# Operational Planning - EV Charging Pool
Optimization of a charging pool for electric vehicles


Operational planning project in which I devise a strategy for charging a pool of electrical vehicles in an industrial-like microgrid.
The objectives of the project consist in minimizing the cost of electricity imports from the main grid, with consideration to the penalty owed to electric vehicle owners if their desired state of charge is not met and with the willingness to maximize revenue from selling unused PV power to the main grid. 

Problem modelled as a MILP optimization with constraints using Python, Pyomo and cbc as an open-source MILP solver.
